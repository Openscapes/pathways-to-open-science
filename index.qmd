## Welcome

**Pathways to Open Science** is a remote event series for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science. Led by Ileana Fenwick of [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) in partnership with [Black in Marine Science (BIMS)](https://www.blackinmarinescience.org/) and [Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS)](https://www.bweems.org/), we are planning the series to begin in mid-January 2023.

### **Program Details**

This remote event series will convene Black environmental and marine researcher community members with the goal of developing a mindset for Open Data Science: the tools and practices enabling reproducible, transparent, and inclusive practices for data intensive science. If you're feeling bogged down by folders full of files with names like "analysis_final_v5.xlsx" and like empowering others, we welcome you to join us!

The event series builds from our work at [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org), where we believe open practices can accelerate data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science. Since 2019 we have mentored \>100 research teams, meeting them where they are as they develop enduring habits and community. The Pathways to Open Science event series consists of six parts (all virtual): 

-   **3 community calls:** 1.5 hour calls with facilitated discussion, mini-lectures and community conversations with Black data scientists, data science leaders and students

-   **3 coworking sessions:** 1 hour calls structured for folks to bring their own work, practice skill building, screenshare, and ask questions. 

All Openscapes events abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://www.openscapes.org/code-of-conduct/).


**How do participants benefit from this event series?**

-   ​​Free of cost 

-   Networking opportunity 

-   Build data science literacy and skills 

-   Encourage community building and collaboration with other HBCU and Black scientists

-   Resume building experience and access to skill development resources after the program is completed

**About Us:**

Ileana Fenwick: as I shared at the RStudio Conference ([slides](https://github.com/IleanaF/rstudio-conf22)), after participating in Openscapes in early 2021, I joined the team to pass forward the power of open science. 

Julie Lowndes launched Openscapes for this same reason, having learned from R and Mozilla communities.
