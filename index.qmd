## Welcome

**Pathways to Open Science** is a remote event series for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science. We empower our community by sharing our stories, learning together, and building skills to expand how data science can improve, accelerate, and support our science. The 2025 series - our 3rd annual - ran weekly from January 23 through February 27. We look forward to 2026 edition! <!--- [**Registration**](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0vc-2grzgrH9URmxCRyV34ZwjvcwCU0ciH) **is now open!** --->

## Program Details

This remote event series convense Black environmental and marine researcher community members with the goal of developing a mindset for Open Data Science: the tools and practices enabling reproducible, transparent, and inclusive practices for data intensive science. If you're feeling bogged down by folders full of files with names like "analysis_final_v5.xlsx" and/or like empowering others, we welcome you to join us!

This is an ongoing [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) collaboration with Black in Marine Science ([BIMS](https://www.blackinmarinescience.org/)), Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science ([BWEEMS](https://www.bweems.org/)) and marine science professors from 7 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program is led by Ileana Fenwick, with Alex Davis, PhD, and Aneese Williams, MSc.

**This 6-part remote event series runs on Thursdays, January 23 - February 27**. Event format alternated weekly (all virtual):

-   3 community calls: 1.5 hour calls with facilitated discussion, mini-lectures and community conversations with Black data scientists, data science leaders and students
    -   January 23, February 6, 20 from 5:00 to 6:30 pm EST
-   3 coworking sessions: 1.5 hour calls structured for folks to bring their own work, their code, or questions, screenshare, and come learn a new skill with us!
    -   January 30, 13, 27 from 5:00 to 6:30 pm EST

**What will Pathways to Open Science look like?**

Check out the speakers and resources shared in our [2025](2025.qmd), [2024](2024.qmd), and [2023](2023.qmd) Series.

The event series builds from our work at [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org), where we believe open practices can accelerate data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science. Since 2019 we have mentored >100 research teams, meeting them where they are as they develop enduring habits and community. All Openscapes events abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://www.openscapes.org/code-of-conduct/).

**How do participants benefit from this event series?**

-   Build data science literacy and skills
-   Encourage community building and collaboration with other HBCU and Black scientists
-   Resume building experience and access to skill development resources after the program is completed
-   Networking opportunity
-   Welcome to the Openscapes community and Slack workspace as a resource for questions and networking
-   Free

## Registration

Registration for 2026 will open in December 2025.

<!--- [Register via Zoom](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0vc-2grzgrH9URmxCRyV34ZwjvcwCU0ciH).---> If you are a Black marine scientist and/or an HBCU student, we would love to have you! We hope you are able to attend all six events, however, you are welcome to join as many as you are able to. Please invite others to join you! If you are an ally, please help us amplify Black voices; we suggest allies do not sign up for this particular series.

She is an open science advocate and Marine Sciences Ph.D. Student at UNC Chapel Hill. Ileana's research focuses on evaluating how marine communities respond to climate change and human impacts. Her work uses innovative quantitative methods to improve our ocean management outcomes. In addition to her research, Ileana is also a fierce advocate for HBCU engagement and equity in open science and marine science through her consulting and volunteer work.

[Alex Davis](http://www.alexandracddavis.com/), PhD, is co-organizing Pathways to Open Science as a representative of [BWEEMS](https://www.bweems.org/). She is a marine ecologist and conservation scientist in a tenure track position at California State University, Northridge in the Biology Department, and works on The Diversity Project at UCLA. Her research uses a combination of skills with diving, GIS, and spatial ecology to address management strategies for marine conservation in temperate and tropical systems. Alex is on the Board of Directors for BWEEMS.

[Aneese Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aneese-williams-mps-80a846b6/), MSc, is co-organizing Pathways to Open Science as a representative of [BIMS](https://www.blackinmarinescience.org/). She is a graduate of Hampton University where she studied Marine & Environmental Science. Aneese has an M.Sc. in Marine Biology & Fisheries from University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS). Currently, Aneese is the Environmental Management Systems Coordinator for the City of West Palm Beach, FL. She manages an Environmental Education Program that allows employees to be more aware of their potential environmental impacts associated with their everyday tasks, highlighting the importance of protecting the environment. Aneese is on the Science Core Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in Learning (SCHOOL) Open Science Team (OST) with Columbia Climate School and is an NSF BIO-LEAPS Advisory Board Member. She is an expert in problem-solving with data, working to "do things better in less time".
