## Welcome

**Pathways to Open Science** is a remote event series for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science. We empower our community by sharing our stories, learning together, and building skills to expand how data science can improve, accelerate, and support our science. The 2025 series will run weekly from January 23 through Feb 27. [**Registration**](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0vc-2grzgrH9URmxCRyV34ZwjvcwCU0ciH) **is now open!**

## Program Details

This remote event series will convene Black environmental and marine researcher community members with the goal of developing a mindset for Open Data Science: the tools and practices enabling reproducible, transparent, and inclusive practices for data intensive science. If you're feeling bogged down by folders full of files with names like "analysis_final_v5.xlsx" and/or like empowering others, we welcome you to join us!

This is an ongoing Openscapes collaboration with Black in Marine Science ([BIMS](https://www.blackinmarinescience.org/)), Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science ([BWEEMS](https://www.bweems.org/)) and HBCU marine science professors. The program is led by Ileana Fenwick, with Alex Davis, PhD, and Aneese Williams, MSc.

**This 6-part remote event series runs on Thursdays, January 23 - February 27**. Event format will alternate weekly (all virtual):

-   3 community calls: 1.5 hour calls with facilitated discussion, mini-lectures and community conversations with Black data scientists, data science leaders and students
    -   January 23, February 6, 20 from 5:00 to 6:30 pm EST
-   3 coworking sessions: 1.5 hour calls structured for folks to bring their own work, their code, or questions, screenshare, and come learn a new skill with us!
    -   January 30, 13, 27 from 5:00 to 6:30 pm EST

**What will Pathways to Open Science look like?**

Check out the speakers and resources shared in our [2024](2024.qmd) and [2023](2023.qmd) Series.

The event series builds from our work at [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org), where we believe open practices can accelerate data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science. Since 2019 we have mentored \>100 research teams, meeting them where they are as they develop enduring habits and community. All Openscapes events abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://www.openscapes.org/code-of-conduct/).

**How do participants benefit from this event series?**

-   Build data science literacy and skills
-   Encourage community building and collaboration with other HBCU and Black scientists
-   Resume building experience and access to skill development resources after the program is completed
-   Networking opportunity
-   Welcome to the Openscapes community and Slack workspace as a resource for questions and networking
-   Free

## Registration

[Register via Zoom](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0vc-2grzgrH9URmxCRyV34ZwjvcwCU0ciH). If you are a Black marine scientist and/or an HBCU student, we would love to have you! We hope you are able to attend all six events, however, you are welcome to join as many as you are able to. Please invite others to join you! If you are an ally, please help us amplify Black voices; we suggest allies do not sign up for this particular series.

[Ileana Fenwick](https://twitter.com/_ileanaf) is PI (Principal Investigator) and Lead of the Pathways to Open Science program and a core Openscapes team member. She is an open science advocate and Marine Sciences Ph.D. Student at UNC Chapel Hill. Ileana's research focuses on evaluating how marine communities respond to climate change and human impacts. Her work uses innovative quantitative methods to improve our ocean management outcomes. In addition to her research, Ileana is also a fierce advocate for HBCU engagement and equity in open science and marine science through her consulting and volunteer work.

[Alex Davis](http://www.alexandracddavis.com/), PhD, is co-organizing Pathways to Open Science as a representative of [BWEEMS](https://www.bweems.org/). She is a marine ecologist and conservation scientist working as a Postdoctoral Fellow on The Diversity Project at UCLA. Alex uses her skills with diving, GIS and spatial ecology to address issues with marine invasive species. Alex is on the Board of Directors for BWEEMS.

[Aneese Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aneese-williams-mps-80a846b6/), MSc, is co-organizing Pathways to Open Science as a representative of [BIMS](https://www.blackinmarinescience.org/). She is a graduate of Hampton University where she studied Marine & Environmental Science. Aneese has an M.Sc. in Marine Biology & Fisheries from University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS). Currently, Aneese is the Environmental Management Systems Coordinator for the City of West Palm Beach, FL. She manages an Environmental Education Program that allows employees to be more aware of their potential environmental impacts associated with their everyday tasks, highlighting the importance of protecting the environment. She is an expert in problem-solving with data, working to "do things better in less time".

[LaWanda Walker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lawanda-walker-b673a71b2/) creates the promotional graphics and content for Pathways to Open Science and coordinates promotion with our collaborators. She is a graduate of Hampton University and current graduate student at the University of Chicago with an interest in nonprofit management and public history.
