    "text": "Program Details\nThis remote event series will convene Black environmental and marine researcher community members with the goal of developing a mindset for Open Data Science: the tools and practices enabling reproducible, transparent, and inclusive practices for data intensive science. If you’re feeling bogged down by folders full of files with names like “analysis_final_v5.xlsx” and/or like empowering others, we welcome you to join us!\nThis 6-part remote event series runs on Thursdays from 5-6:30pm ET, January 26 - March 2. Event format will alternate weekly (all virtual):\n\n3 community calls: 1.5 hour calls with facilitated discussion, mini-lectures and community conversations with Black data scientists, data science leaders and students\n\nJanuary 26, February 9, 23\n\n3 coworking sessions: 1.5 hour calls structured for folks to bring their own work, practice skill building, screenshare, and ask questions.\n\nFebruary 2, 16, March 2\n\n\nThe event series builds from our work at Openscapes, where we believe open practices can accelerate data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science. Since 2019 we have mentored >100 research teams, meeting them where they are as they develop enduring habits and community. All Openscapes events abide by our Code of Conduct.\nHow do participants benefit from this event series?\n\nBuild data science literacy and skills\nEncourage community building and collaboration with other HBCU and Black scientists\nResume building experience and access to skill development resources after the program is completed\nNetworking opportunity\nWelcome to the Openscapes community and Slack workspace as a resource for questions and networking\nFree of cost"
