    "text": "Program Details\nThis remote event series will convene Black environmental and marine researcher community members with the goal of developing a mindset for Open Data Science: the tools and practices enabling reproducible, transparent, and inclusive practices for data intensive science. If you’re feeling bogged down by folders full of files with names like “analysis_final_v5.xlsx” and/or like empowering others, we welcome you to join us!\nThis 6-part remote event series runs on Thursdays, January 26 - March 2. Event format will alternate weekly (all virtual):\n\n3 community calls: 1.5 hour calls with facilitated discussion, mini-lectures and community conversations with Black data scientists, data science leaders and students\n\nJanuary 26, February 9, 23 from 5:00 to 6:30 pm EST\n\n3 coworking sessions: 1.5 hour calls structured for folks to bring their own work, practice skill building, screenshare, and ask questions.\n\nFebruary 2, 16, March 2 from 5:00 to 6:00 pm EST\n\n\n\nJanuary 26: What is open science anyway? What can it mean for you?\nLearn all about open science and data organization skills that will save you time and energy!\nSpeakers\n\nAlex Davis, Postdoctoral Fellow, UCLA, and Pathways co-organizer\nIleana Fenwick, Ph.D. Candidate, UNC Chapel Hill and Pathways Lead\nAneese Williams, Environmental Management Systems Coordinator for the City of West Palm Beach, FL and Pathways co-organizer\n\n\n\nFebruary 9: Building our skills for a better tomorrow\nHear from experts about building community and your data science toolkit for more efficient research!\nSpeakers\n\nLaTreese Denson, Stock Assessment Analyst, NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center\nJason Williams, Assistant Director, External Collaborations at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, DNALC; Education, Outreach, and Training lead for CyVerse\n\n\n\nFebruary 23: Data Science is for US\nJoin the conversation! Hear all about our journeys into data science and building community for innovation.\nSpeakers\n\nSherAaron Hurt, Director of Workshops, The Carpentries\nTony Orr, Research Scientist, NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center\nDawn Wright, Chief Scientist, Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI)\n\n\n\nJoin us every other week for coworking!\nFeb 2, 16, Mar 2, 5:00 - 6:00 pm EST\nBring your code, bring a question or come learn a new skill with us!\nThe event series builds from our work at Openscapes, where we believe open practices can accelerate data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science. Since 2019 we have mentored >100 research teams, meeting them where they are as they develop enduring habits and community. All Openscapes events abide by our Code of Conduct.\nHow do participants benefit from this event series?\n\nBuild data science literacy and skills\nEncourage community building and collaboration with other HBCU and Black scientists\nResume building experience and access to skill development resources after the program is completed\nNetworking opportunity\nWelcome to the Openscapes community and Slack workspace as a resource for questions and networking\nFree"

She is an open science advocate and Marine Sciences Ph.D. Student at UNC Chapel Hill. Ileana’s research focuses on evaluating how marine communities respond to climate change and human impacts. Her work uses innovative quantitative methods to improve our ocean management outcomes. In addition to her research, Ileana is also a fierce advocate for HBCU engagement and equity in open science and marine science through her consulting and volunteer work.\nAlex Davis is co-organizing Pathways to Open Science as a representative of BWEEMS. She is a marine ecologist and conservation scientist working as a Postdoctoral Fellow on The Diversity Project at UCLA. Alex uses her skills with diving, GIS and spatial ecology to address issues with marine invasive species. Alex is on the Board of Directors for BWEEMS.\nAneese Williams is co-organizing Pathways to Open Science as a representative of BIMS. She is a graduate of Hampton University where she studied Marine & Environmental Science. Aneese has an M.Sc. in Marine Biology & Fisheries from University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS). Currently, Aneese is the Environmental Management Systems Coordinator for the City of West Palm Beach, FL. She manages an Environmental Education Program that allows employees to be more aware of their potential environmental impacts associated with their everyday tasks, highlighting the importance of protecting the environment. She is an expert in problem-solving with data, working to \"do things better in less time\".\nJulie Lowndes founded and directs Openscapes and provides support for the Pathways to Open Science program.\nStefanie Butland is a core Openscapes team member and provides support for the Pathways to Open Science program.\n\nTimeline\n\nOctober 2022: Partnership planning\nWeek of November 14-18: Liaison onboarding call\nDecember-January 2023 planning meetings with liaisons and social media engagement, registration opens\nJanuary 26, 2023 - event series kick-off\nMarch 2 - event series concludes\nMarch-April - followup and publish cross-posted blog post!"
