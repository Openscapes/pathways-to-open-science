    "text": "Pathways to Open Science is a remote event series for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science. Led by Ileana Fenwick of Openscapes in partnership with Black in Marine Science (BIMS) and Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS), we are planning the series to begin in mid-January 2023.\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis remote event series will convene Black environmental and marine researcher community members with the goal of developing a mindset for Open Data Science: the tools and practices enabling reproducible, transparent, and inclusive practices for data intensive science. If you’re feeling bogged down by folders full of files with names like “analysis_final_v5.xlsx” and like empowering others, we welcome you to join us!\nThe event series builds from our work at Openscapes, where we believe open practices can accelerate data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science. Since 2019 we have mentored >100 research teams, meeting them where they are as they develop enduring habits and community. The Pathways to Open Science event series consists of six parts (all virtual): \n\n3 community calls: 1.5 hour calls with facilitated discussion, mini-lectures and community conversations with Black data scientists, data science leaders and students\n3 coworking sessions: 1 hour calls structured for folks to bring their own work, practice skill building, screenshare, and ask questions. \n\nAll Openscapes events abide by our Code of Conduct.\nHow do participants benefit from this event series?\n\n​​Free of cost \nNetworking opportunity \nBuild data science literacy and skills \nEncourage community building and collaboration with other HBCU and Black scientists\nResume building experience and access to skill development resources after the program is completed\nWelcome to the Openscapes community and Slack workspace as a resource for questions and networking\n\n\n\n\nIleana Fenwick\nAlex Davis\nAneese Williams\nJulie Lowndes\nStefanie Butland\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 2022: Partnership planning\nWeek of November 14-18: Liaison onboarding call\nDecember-January planning meetings with liaisons and social media engagement, registration opens\nWeek of January 16 - event series kick-off\n\n\n\n\nBWEEMS: Website • Instagram • Twitter\nBIMS: Website • Instagram • Twitter • YouTube\nOpenscapes: Website • Twitter • YouTube\n\n\n\nTo learn more about Openscapes approaches:\n\nA Journey to Data Science: Tools for Equity and Diversity in STEM - July 28, 2022: Talk by Ileana Fenwick at RStudio Conference (video) (20 minutes)\nSupercharge your research: a 10-week plan for open data science (Lowndes et al. 2019, Nature)\n\n\n\n\nThis event series is possible through funding from Code for Science & Society through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
