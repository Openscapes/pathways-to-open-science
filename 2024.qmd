## Coworking Sessions

Coworking comes in many flavors. For us, coworking involves doing our own work at the same time together with opportunities to check in, and sometimes screenshare to get feedback or solve a problem. Seeing how other people work is a big part of this transition to working more openly and collaboratively.

We have breakout rooms to meet the speakers, for topic-based screenshares and discussions, and for socializing or quiet working. **Follow the links below to our collaborative notes doc to see the resources that speakers and participants shared** on R and tidy data, Python, math, GIS, ArcGIS, Storymaps, data visualization, Quarto, GitHub, ocean biodiversity data, creating an ORCID profile, NASA TOPS Open Science 101 Modules, training and paid internships, Data that’s FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and open, replicability and reproducibility.
