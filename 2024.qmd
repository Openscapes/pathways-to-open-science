## Coworking Sessions

Coworking comes in many flavors. For us, coworking involves doing our own work at the same time together with opportunities to check in, and sometimes screenshare to get feedback or solve a problem. Seeing how other people work is a big part of this transition to working more openly and collaboratively.

We have breakout rooms to meet the speakers, for topic-based screenshares and discussions, and for socializing or quiet working.

### Coworking 1, February 1

### Coworking 2, February 15

### Coworking 3, February 29
